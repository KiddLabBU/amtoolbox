%LINDEMANN1986a_FIG7 Reproduces fig. 7 from lindemann1986a
%
%   LINDEMANN1986a_FIG7() reproduces fig.7 from lindemann1986a. Therefore the
%   cross-correlation of pure tone sinusoids with different ITDs is calculated. 
%   Because of the stationary character of the input signals T_int = inf is used
%   to produce only one time step in the crosscorr output from lindemann.
%   This is calculated for different ITDs and different inhibition factors c_s
%   (0:0.2:1). Afterwards for every c_s the centroid (for formula see the bottom
%   line of this function9 of the auditory image is
%   calculated and plotted dependend opn the ITD.

% ------- Computation ----------------------------------------------------
% Sampling rate
fs = 44100;
% Frequency of the sinusoid
f = 500;
fc = round(freqtoerb(f));   % corresponding frequency channel

% Model parameter
T_int = inf;
w_f = 0;
M_f = 6; % not used, if w_f==0

% Calculate crosscorrelations for 21 ITD points between 0~ms and 1~ms
nitds = 21; % number of used ITDs
ndl = 45;   % length of the delay line
ii = 1;
for itd = linspace(0,1,nitds); 
    % Generate ITD shifted sinusoid
    sig = itdsin(f,itd,fs);
    % Use only the beginning of the signal to generate only one time instance of
    % the cross-correlation
    % FIXME: also we use only stationary inhibition here by varying c_s the
    % results depends much on the length of the used signal. I think Lindemann 
    % has not stated this fact nor calculated the fading time, so we have to do
    % this.
    % This also leads to a asymmetrie for ITD = T/2 which is not the case by
    % Lindemann!!!
    sig = sig(1:ceil(0.01*fs),:);
    
    jj = 1;
    for c_s = 0:0.2:1
        % Calculate cross-correlation (and squeeze due to T_int==inf)
        tmp = squeeze(lindemann(sig,fs,c_s,w_f,M_f,T_int));
        % Store the needed frequency channel. NOTE: the cross-correlation
        % calculation starts with channel 5, so we have to subtract 5.
        cc = tmp(:,fc-5);
        % Calculate the position of the centroid
        cen(jj,ii) = centroid(cc);
        %
        jj = jj+1;
    end

% ------ Plotting --------------------------------------------------------
% Generate time axis

for jj = 1:6
    plot(itd,cen(jj,:));
    hold on;
