\begin_layout Title
Using git to develop AMT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Git is a version control system developed by Linus Thorvalds to maintain
 the Linux kernel.
 It is a distributed version control system scalable to extremely large
 projects, because there is not central repository.
 In Git, every developer can have his/her own repository.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Git has been choosen for the AM toolbox, because 
\emph on
branching
\emph default
 in Git is very easy.
 This allows each developer to work without disturbing the others, because
 each sub-project is developed in its own branch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though each developer has his own repository, there 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 a main one, namely the one of sourceforge.
 This means that we don't using Git in the intended way, using multiple
 repositories, but instead use a little like SVN with properly working branches!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Structure of the AMTOOLBOX Sourceforge repository
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sourceforge repository has several branches.
 The idea is that you only work on specific things in specific branches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The main branch is called 
\emph on
master
\emph default
.
 Files in this branch are the ones that gets uploaded by a file release.
 Don't do 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 new development work on this branch, use it only to fix bugs.
 Development are done in other branches, which are then merged into master
 when the development is finished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another branch is called 
\emph on
devel
\emph default
.
 This branch should contains all files necessary for developing on AMT.
 Don't do any work on this branch, merge branches into it.
 Since this branch is a superset of 
\emph on
master
\emph default
, then 
\emph on
master
\emph default
 will be merged into this when ever the documentation needs to be upgraded
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All development work takes place on separate branches.
 Create a branch for your work, push it to sorceforge for backup and for
 other people's comments, and then merge it into master when you are done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Git works by having both 
\emph on
local
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
remote
\emph default
 branches.
 You must connect your local branch to a remote branch in order to track
 it.
 For the sake of less confusion, I suggest to use the same names for the
 local and remote branch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Git on Windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use Git on windows install 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "msysgit"
target "http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/"

\end_inset


\family default
\lang english
 and 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TortoiseGit"
target "http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting the code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get the reposity, you need to clone the Sourceforge one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
git clone ssh://soender@amtoolbox.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/amtoolbox/amtoolbox
 amtoolbox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows, right-click in where you want the directory, choose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Git clone ...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and then enter the URL above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will create a repository 
\family typewriter
amtoolbox
\family default
, which is related remotely to the Sourceforge repository.
 After this command, change to the 
\family typewriter
amtoolbox
\family default
 directory for all further operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this operation, you will only have obtained the 
\family typewriter
master
\family default
 branch.
 To see the other remote branches, type
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
git branch -r
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see you local ones, type just
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
git branch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows, both these task can be done in the right-click menu TortoiseGit
 -> Checkout/Branch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get the code from any of the remote branches, type
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
git branch --track devel origin/devel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will connect the local branch to the remote branch, both named devel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Windows, again use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

TortoiseGit -> Checkout/Branch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 menu, but remember to check the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Create New Branch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box if you are getting a remote branch for the first time.
 Choose the same name (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
devel
\family default
) as the remote branch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To switch to this branch use
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
git checkout devel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The checkout command is always used to switch between branches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Working with the code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To commit, use 
\family typewriter
git commit
\family default
, this is similar to SVN or CVS, only difference is that you only commit
 to your local tree, and not to Sourceforge.
 To upload your changes, use 
\family typewriter
git push
\family default
, and to get new updates, use 
\family typewriter
git pull
\family default
.
\end_layout
