% LINDEMANN Calculates a binaural activation pattern
%   Usage: outsig = lindemann(insig,w_f,c_s,fs)
%
%   Input parameters:
%       insig       - binaural signal for which the cross-correlation
%                     should be calculated
%       w_f         - monaural sensitivity at the end of the delay line, 
%                     0 <= w_f < 1
%       c_s         - constant inhibition factor, 0 <= c_s <= 1 
%                     (0.0 = no inhibition)
%       fs          - sampling rate
%
%   Output parameters:
%       crosscorr   - A matrix containing the cross-correlation signal
%                     for every frequency channel fc and every time step n. 
%                     The format of this matrix is output(n,m,fc), where m
%                     denotes the correlation (delay line) time step.
%
%   LINDEMANN(insig,w_f,c_s,fs) calculates a binaural activity map for the
%   given insig using a cross-correlation (delay-line) mechanism. The
%   calculation is done for every frequency band in the range 5-40 Erb.
%
%   The steps of the binaural model to calculate the result are the
%   following:
%
%     1) The given stimulus is filtered using an erb bank to
%        get 36 frequency bands containing a stimulus waveform.
%
%     2) In a second step the auditory nerve is siumulated by extracting the
%        envelpoe using a first order low pass filter with a cutoff frequency
%        of 800 Hz and half-wave rectification.
%
%     3) Calculation of the cross-correlation between the left and right
%        channel.  This is done using the model described in Lindemann
%        (1986a). These are extensions to the delay line model of Jeffres (1948).
%        Lindemann has extended the delay line model of Jeffres (1948) by a
%        contralateral inhibition, which introduce the ILD to the model.  Also
%        monaural detectors were extended, to handle monaural signals (and some
%        stimuli with a split off of the lateralization image).  A detailed
%        description of these cross-correlation steps is given in the
%        binaural_correlation function.
