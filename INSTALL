Auditory-Modeling Toolbox (AMT)

--------- Running the AMT --------------------

AMT depends on LTFAT.  You must first download LTFAT from
http://ltfat.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the downloaded file. 
In the AMT, there is a pre-prepared directory /thirdparty/ltfat
where the LTFAT can be stored and will be automatically recognized by 
the AMT. Alternatively, set the path to your LTFAT directory to the 
search path of Matlab/Octave.

To start the AMT, type "amtstart".

The "amtstart" command will add all the necessary
subdirectories (so please don't add these manually), and will print
statements telling you which backend you are currently using.

In order to run all the AMT functionality:
  
  1) install the SOFA API version >= 1.0 from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sofacoustics>.
     In the AMT, there is a prepared directory `thirdparty/SOFA`. Alternatively, save 
     the SOFA API anywhere and add the path to the search path. 

  2) install SFS Toolbox version >= 1.0 from <https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs>. 
     In the AMT, there is a prepared directory `thirdparty/sfs`. Alternatively, save 
     the SOFA API anywhere and add the path to the search path. 

  3) install Python version >= 2.6 with `numpy` and `scipi` packages. 
     On Linux, `sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-numpy` can be applied.

  4) run `amtmex` to compile some models. You will need a compiler working in your 
     Matlab/Octave environment (see `help mex`).

  5) in the directory `src/verhulst`, run `make` (Linux) or `make.bat` (Windows).

  6) have the Optimization Toolbox for Matlab installed.

See <http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/doc/index.php> for more details.

More help on the start of the AMT is available by typing "help amtstart".
