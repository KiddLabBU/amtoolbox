function aud = freqtoaud(scale,freq);
%FREQTOAUD  Converts frequencies (Hz) to auditory scale units.
%   Usage: aud = freqtoaud(scale,freq);
%
%   FREQTOAUD(scale,freq) converts values on frequency scale (measured in Hz) to
%   values on the selected auditory scale. The value of the parameter
%   scale determines the auditory scale:
%
%-    'mel'  -  The mel scale is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by
%               listeners to be equal in distance from one another. The
%               reference point between this scale and normal frequency
%               measurement is defined by equating a 1000 Hz tone, 40 dB above
%               the listener's threshold, with a pitch of 1000 mels.
%               The mel-scale is defined in Stevens et. al (1937).
%
%-    'bark'  - The bark-scale is originally defined in Zwicker (1961). A
%               distance of 1 on the bark scale is known as a critical
%               band. The implementation provided in this function is
%               described in Traunmuller (1990).
%
%-    'erb'   - A distance of 1 erb is equal to the equivalent rectangular
%               bandwidth of the auditory filters at that point on the
%               frequency scale. The scale is normalized such that 0 erbs
%               corresponds to 0 Hz. The width of the auditory filters were
%               determined by a notched-noise experiment. The erb scale is
%               defined in Glasberg and Moore (1990).
%
%-    'erb83' - This is the original defintion of the erb scale given in
%               Moore. et al. (1983).
