%IHCENVELOPE   Inner hair cell envelope extration
%   Usage:  outsig=ihcenvelope(insig,fs,methodname);
%
%   IHCENVELOPE(insig,fs,methodname) extract the envelope of an input signal
%   insig sampled with a sampling frequency of fs Hz. The envelope
%   extraction is performed by half-wave rectification followed by low pass
%   filtering. This is a common model of the signal transduction of the
%   inner hair cells.
%
%   The parameter methodname describes the kind of low pass filtering to
%   use. The name refers to a set of papers where in this particular
%   method has been utilized or studied. The options are
%
%-    'dau'     - Use a 2nd order Butterworth filter with a cut-off
%                 frequency of 1000 Hz. This method has been used in all
%                 models deriving from the original 1996 model by 
%                 Dau et. al. These models are mostly monaural in nature.
%
%-    'hilbert' - Use the Hilbert envelope instead of the half-wave
%                 rectification and low pass filtering. This is not a
%                 releastic model of the inner hair envelope extraction
%                 process, but the option is included for completeness.
%
%-    'lindemann' - Use a 1st order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency
%                 of 800 Hz. This method is defined in the paper
%                 Lindemann 1986a. Mostly used for binaural models.
