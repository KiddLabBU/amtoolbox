%DATA_ZWICKER1961  Data for the Bark scale
%   Usage: data = data_zwicker1961;
%
%   `data_zwicker1961` returns the data points defining the notion of
%   critical bands. The output data consists of the frequency limit of
%   each band in Hz.
%
%   To get the bandwidth of each channel, simply use::
%
%     bw = diff(data_zwicker1961);
%
%   The first entry has been modified from the original paper: It was
%   originally 20 Hz, but in Zwicker and Fastl 1999 this was changed to 0
%   Hz.
