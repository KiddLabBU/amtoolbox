% Gfb_Synthesizer_new creates a new synthesizer object that fits to the
% given analyzer.
%
% PARAMETERS:
% analyzer                  an analyzer struct as returned by Gfb_Analyzer_new
% desired_delay_in_seconds  the desired group delay of the analysis-synthesis
%                           system in seconds.  Greater delays result in better
%                           output signal quality.  Minimum delay is
%                           (1 / analyzer.fs)
% synthesizer               the constructed Gfb_Synthesizer structure
