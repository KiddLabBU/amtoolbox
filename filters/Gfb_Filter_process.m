%
% The filter processes the input data.
%
% PARAMETERS
% filter  A Gfb_Filter struct created from Gfb_Filter_new.  The filter
%         will be returned with an updated filter state as the second
%         return parameter
% input   A vector containing the input signal to process
% output  A vector containing the filter's output signal

% for compatibility of the filter state with the MEX extension, we
% have to divide the filter state by the filter coefficient after the
