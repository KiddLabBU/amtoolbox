%
% Computes the frequency response of the gammatone filter at the frequency z.
% 
% PARAMETERS
% filter  A Gfb_Filter struct as created by Gfb_Filter_new.
% z       A vector of z-plane frequencies where the frequency response should
%         be computed. z = exp(2i*pi*f[Hz]/fs[Hz])
% zresponse The complex response of the filter at z.
