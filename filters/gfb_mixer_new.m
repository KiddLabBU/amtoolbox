function mixer = gfb_mixer_new(analyzer, delay, iterations)
% mixer = gfb_mixer_new(analyzer, delay, iterations)
% 
% gfb_mixer_new creates a gfb_mixer object with gain factors suitable
% to calculate a weighted sum of the bands present in the output of the
% given delay.  The gain factors are computed using a numerical optimization
% method described in [Herzke & Hohmann 2007].
% The <iterations> argument may be omitted.
%
%  Input parameters:
% analyzer   A gfb_analyzer structure as created by gfb_analyzer_new. The
%            mixer created by this function can act as part of a synthesizer
%            that resynthesizes the output of this analyzer
% delay      A gfb_Delay structure as created by gfb_delay_new, Together with
%            the mixer created by this function, this delay can form a
%            synthesizer that resynthesizes the output of the analyzer
% iterations The gain factors are approximated numerically in iterations.
%            If this parameter is omitted, then the number of iterations will
%            be  GFB_GAINCALC_ITERATIONS (see gfb_set_constants.m, usually
%            =100)
