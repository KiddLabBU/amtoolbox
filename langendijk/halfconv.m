function [ outsig ] = halfconv( ir1,stim )
% HALFCONV calculates the fast convolution with fft but without ifft
% Usage:        [ outsig ] = halfconv( ir1,stim )
% Input arguments:
%     ir1:      (modified) impulse responses of DFTs for all positions and
%               both ears
%     stim:     stimulus (time domain)
% Output argument:
%     outsig:   convolution of stimulus with DTFs in frequency domain
